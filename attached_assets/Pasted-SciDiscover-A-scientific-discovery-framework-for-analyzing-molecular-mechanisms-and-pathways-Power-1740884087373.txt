    Autophagy-dependent antigen presentation pathways altered by microbiota disruption

Relevant Genes and Their Roles

    FOXP3: Master regulator of Treg differentiation, hypomethylated in response to microbiota-derived SCFAs; early antibiotic exposure prevents proper HDAC inhibition, leading to insufficient FOXP3 expression and reduced Treg populations

    RORγt: Transcription factor essential for Th17 and ILC3 development, activated by microbiota-derived AhR ligands; antibiotic disruption of tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria reduces RORγt activation, impairing IL-22 production

    RELa/NF-κB: Central inflammatory transcription factor abnormally activated during dysbiosis-induced barrier dysfunction; aberrant early-life activation due to antibiotic exposure creates epigenetic memory in myeloid cells

    HDAC1/2: Histone deacetylases normally inhibited by butyrate; antibiotic-induced butyrate deficiency results in excess HDAC activity, affecting chromatin accessibility in developing immune cells

    STAT3: Transcription factor downstream of IL-22 receptor signaling; impaired activation due to dysbiosis disrupts antimicrobial peptide production and epithelial regeneration

    ZO-1/OCLN/CLDN1: Tight junction proteins whose expression is regulated by microbiota-derived signals; antibiotic-induced dysbiosis delays proper tight junction formation, increasing intestinal permeability

    REGNIII-γ: Antimicrobial peptide induced by IL-22 signaling; production impaired by antibiotic-disrupted ILC3 development, allowing pathobiont expansion

    GPR43/FFAR2: SCFA receptor mediating immunomodulatory effects of acetate and propionate; insufficient stimulation due to antibiotic-induced microbial metabolite alterations affects neutrophil and macrophage function

Detailed Molecular Mechanisms

Early-life antibiotic exposure disrupts critical microbiota-immune developmental crosstalk, causing dysregulated SCFA-AhR-NF-κB signaling cascades that epigenetically reprogram immune cells, resulting in impaired intestinal barrier development, skewed T cell differentiation, and long-term immune dysfunction predisposing to inflammatory and allergic diseases.
Temporal Sequence of Events

    Maternal transfer of pioneer microbial species during birth and early feeding (0-3 days)

    Initial pattern recognition receptor engagement and innate immune calibration (3-14 days)

    Early SCFA production and epithelial barrier development (14-28 days)

    ILC3 expansion and IL-22-mediated antimicrobial peptide production (1-2 months)

    Establishment of GALT structures and initial naive T cell priming (2-3 months)

    Development of B cell follicles and initiation of SIgA production (3-4 months)

    Stabilization of microbial community and immune homeostasis (4-12 months)

    Consolidation of epigenetic programming affecting long-term immune function (12+ months)

Supporting Experimental Evidence

    Mouse models show antibiotic exposure during first 2 weeks of life, but not later, results in persistent increase in Th17/Treg ratios associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease

    Germ-free animals exhibit impaired FOXP3+ Treg development that can be rescued by SCFA supplementation, particularly butyrate, through HDAC inhibition mechanisms

    Early-life antibiotics in mice alter H3K27ac marks in intestinal macrophages that persist into adulthood and correlate with altered responses to inflammatory challenges

    Human cohort studies reveal associations between infant antibiotic exposure and increased risk of asthma, allergies and IBD that correlate with critical windows in immune development

    Metagenomic studies show antibiotic-treated infants have decreased abundance of SCFA-producing Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species with concurrent reduction in fecal SCFA levels

    ILC3-deficient mice display compromised epithelial barrier function and increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens, mimicking effects seen in antibiotic-exposed neonatal mice

    Antibiotic exposure during critical windows alters tryptophan metabolism by gut microbiota, reducing AhR ligand production and impairing IL-22-dependent intestinal homeostasis

    Fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy donors can reverse some immunological defects in antibiotic-treated mice, confirming the causative role of the microbiota disruption
