Extended thinking models

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a hybrid model capable of both standard thinking as well as extended thinking modes. In standard mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet operates similarly to other models in the Claude 3 family. In extended thinking mode, Claude will output its thinking before outputting its response, allowing you insight into its reasoning process.
​
Claude 3.7 overview

Claude 3.7 Sonnet operates in two modes:

    Standard mode: Similar to previous Claude models, providing direct responses without showing internal reasoning
    Extended thinking mode: Shows Claude’s reasoning process before delivering the final answer

​
When to use standard mode

Standard mode works well for most general use cases, including:

    General content generation
    Basic coding assistance
    Routine agentic tasks
    Computer use guidance
    Most conversational applications

​
When to use extended thinking mode

Extended thinking mode excels in these key areas:

    Complex analysis: Financial, legal, or data analysis involving multiple parameters and factors
    Advanced STEM problems: Mathematics, physics, research & development
    Long context handling: Processing and synthesizing information from extensive inputs
    Constraint optimization: Problems with multiple competing requirements
    Detailed data generation: Creating comprehensive tables or structured information sets
    Complex instruction following: Chatbots with intricate system prompts and many factors to consider
    Structured creative tasks: Creative writing requiring detailed planning, outlines, or managing multiple narrative elements

Getting started with Claude 3.7 Sonnet

If you are trying Claude 3.7 Sonnet for the first time, here are some tips:

    Start with standard mode: Begin by using Claude 3.7 Sonnet without extended thinking to establish a baseline performance
    Identify improvement opportunities: Try turning on extended thinking mode at a low budget to see if your use case would benefit from deeper reasoning. It might be the case that your use case would benefit more from more detailed prompting in standard mode rather than extended thinking from Claude.
    Gradual implementation: If needed, incrementally increase the thinking budget while testing performance against your requirements.
    Optimize token usage: Once you reach acceptable performance, set appropriate token limits to manage costs.
    Explore new possibilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, with and without extended thinking, is more capable than previous Claude models in a variety of domains. We encourage you to try Claude 3.7 Sonnet for use cases where you previously experienced limitations with other models.

General model information

​
Max tokens and context window changes with Claude 3.7 Sonnet

In older Claude models (prior to Claude 3.7 Sonnet), if the sum of prompt tokens and max_tokens exceeded the model’s context window, the system would automatically adjust max_tokens to fit within the context limit. This meant you could set a large max_tokens value and the system would silently reduce it as needed.

With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, max_tokens (which includes your thinking budget when thinking is enabled) is enforced as a strict limit. The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + max_tokens exceeds the context window size.
​
Extended output capabilities (beta)

Claude 3.7 Sonnet can also produce substantially longer responses than previous models with support for up to 128K output tokens (beta)—more than 15x longer than other Claude models. This expanded capability is particularly effective for extended thinking use cases involving complex reasoning, rich code generation, and comprehensive content creation.

This feature can be enabled by passing an anthropic-beta header of output-128k-2025-02-19.

curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "anthropic-beta: output-128k-2025-02-19" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data \
'{
    "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    "max_tokens": 128000,
    "thinking": {
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 32000
    },
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Generate a comprehensive analysis of..."
        }
    ]
}'

When using extended thinking with longer outputs, you can allocate a larger thinking budget to support more thorough reasoning, while still having ample tokens available for the final response.
