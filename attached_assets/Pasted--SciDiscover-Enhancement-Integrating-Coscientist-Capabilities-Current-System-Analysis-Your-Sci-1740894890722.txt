 SciDiscover Enhancement: Integrating Coscientist Capabilities

## Current System Analysis

Your SciDiscover framework currently integrates three key components:

1. **SciAgent**: Handles hypothesis generation
2. **KG-COI**: Performs knowledge graph operations
3. **PubTator3**: Provides fact-checking and entity identification

This system uses LLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic for reasoning and supports connecting concepts and finding deep molecular links. While this approach is solid, Google's Coscientist represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted scientific discovery.

## Coscientist: Key Architecture and Capabilities

Google's Coscientist is a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0 with several innovative features:

- **Multi-agent architecture** with specialized roles (Generation, Reflection, Ranking, Evolution, etc.)
- **"Generate, debate, and evolve" methodology** for hypothesis refinement
- **Tournament-based evaluation** using Elo ratings
- **Test-time compute scaling** for improved reasoning
- **Asynchronous task framework** for flexible resource allocation
- **Context memory** for persistent state across iterations
- **Expert-in-the-loop design** enabling scientist collaboration
- **Tool integration** including web search and specialized AI models

The system has demonstrated impressive results in three biomedical applications: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance.
